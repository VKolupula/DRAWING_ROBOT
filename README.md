## DRAWING_ROBOT
 Build a robot that extracts line traces from an image and program it to reproduce and duplicate the images as a drawing on a whiteboard.

# Applying Concepts from Trigonometry to Control The Movements of the Robot
In this project, you learned how to decompose movements through trigonometry to calculate the distances that allow the robot to draw on the whiteboard. You combined trigonometry with equations of motion to move the robot to specific points on your whiteboard. You did it all using MATLAB scripts and the information on the motors from its respective datasheet.
